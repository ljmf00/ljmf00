Hey there :wave:,

I'm a low-level back-end developer with full hardware power. I'm interested in developing compilers
and parsers and I also like to develop tooling and integrate them. I'm the founder of
[@aurorafossorg](https://gitlab.com/aurorafossorg/).

Check out my "open-sauce" CV [here](https://keybase.pub/ljmf00/documents/) and academic transcripts.
